                Hey there! I'm Jane, a 17-year-old high school junior who loves old-school arcade games, pixel art, and 8-bit music. Whenever I'm not busy with schoolwork, you'll find me at the local arcade, trying to beat my high score in Pac-Man. Recently, I've been exploring the world of retro game development. Dive deeper into my page to discover my love for pixels and retro vibes!
